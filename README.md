# Getting Started with HTML

HTML is the "language" of the web, so as a user of the web, it's the language we have spent the majority of my time. 

## Anatomy of an HTML tag

The fundamental building block of HTML is a tag. 
Tags allows developers to tell things to the browser like "this text have to be a header and include an image". 

Tags all follow the same formate like this: 

```
<tag-text>
<br> #Create a new line. 
```
Most HTML tags work just like this:


[X]Opening tag, which states what kind of tag weâ€™re using;
[Y]The text we want the tag to be applied to;
[Z]Closing tag, which makes sure the tag is limited to a certain piece of text.

## Basic HTML Document Structure.

```
<html> 
 <head>
 </head>
 <body>
   <h1>Profile</h1>
     Hello my name is Jhan.
   <br>
   <p>
     I've studying at The Flatiroon School for 1 hour. Be a good DevOps is my dream but I also want to be a Fullstack
     developer in Future. 
   </p>
 </body>
</html>
```

# Undestanding Links in HTML
In HTML Links allows to connect our websites and pages to each other. They give the world wide web its power by simply allowing one document to lead to the next other.

```
<a href="http://example.com">
  <img src="myimage.jpg" alt="Alternate text">
</a>

This tells to your mail application to open.
<a href="mailto:webmaster@example.com">This is an email link</a>

<p id="tips">Useful Tips Section</p>
<a href="#tips">Jump to Useful Tips Section</a>

This tells to your phone that you can dial this num.
<a href="tel:555-555-5555">This is a phone number link</a>
```

## Relative and Absolute file paths.

There are to ways to express where we want to got. We can use either a relative file path or an absolute file path. 

## Relative 
```
about.html
```
Relative paths describe the location of resources whitin the same file system.

## Absolute

```
http://example.com/about.html
```
Absolute paths describe the location of resources on the entire internet at large. 

You should use the relative path when linking to content whitin your own website. Then use absolute paths when linking to content on other remote websites. 

## Sumary 

We can link to other pages either on our own website or on the internet as a whole by using the ```a``` tag and a ```href``` attribute, which specifies where we want the link to go. We use either a relative or absolute file path to determinate the link destination. 

# CSS

Cascade Style Sheets is broken down in to sections, first we have to tell the browser what we want to change. Then we tell the browser how we want that thing changed.

Example 

```
body{
  color: red;
  font-weight: bold;
}
```

If we break that down a bit the word body is telling CSS what to change. 
The color:red; is telling CSS how to change that. In addition to the how and the want, we have some syntax requirements as well. Let's add in another change to the body. Change the code in the CSS tab to say. 

## Selecting elements

If we wanted only our header to be red, but the rest of the body to be black all to do is change the "what" in our CSS. So we need to change the "body" to H1.

```
h1 { 
  color: red;
}

p {
  font-weight: bold;
}
```

If you want to customize some texts you can also use the "id" selector to just change some items. 

## Deep on CSS Selectors

1. Review Type Selector
2. Review Class Selector
3. Review ID Selector
4. Review Compound Selector
5. Review Descendent Selector
6. Review Child
7. Review Adjacent Sibling
8. Review General Sibling 
9. Review Universal
10. Review Attribute Selectors
11. Review Pseudo Selectors 

### Selectors

CSS gives us variety of ways to select different elements and style with them.  

*1) Select by Type:* 
This selects an specific element selected with his element name.

```
p {
  color: red;
}
```

*2) Select by Class* 
This selects an element matching class attribute name. This selector indicated by the preceeding . dot (period)

```
.container {
  font-weight: bold;
}
```

Additionaly you can apply a class name to as many elements as you like across any pages in your website. This is a good selector for Sprinkling the same style to many different elements. 

You can also apply more than one class to the same element. For example, let's apply two classes to the same paragraph. 


```
<span class="thick alert"> Warning... </p>
```

```
.thick{
  font-weight: bold;
}

.alert {color: red;}

```

*3) Select by ID* 

This selects an element with matching id attribute name. This selector is indicated by the preceeding hashtag symbol.

```
<div id="box"> I'm a cajita :v </div>
```
```
#box {
  background: blue;
}
```

A single Id name should only be applied to one element per page. 

*4) Compound*

This selects all matched elements in the compound set. This selector is indicated by a "," separating the selectos of the set. Each element within the comma separated list will be styled the same.

```
<h1>Heading</h1>
<h2>Subheading</h2>
<div id="box"> I'm a box </div>
```

```
h1, h2, #box { 
  font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;
}
```

*5) Descendent*

This selects an element that is nested inside of a specific parent element. This selector is indicated by a "space" keyboard between the parent and the child to be selected. 

```
<ul id="nav">
  <li>Child</li>
</ul>
```

```
#nav li{ 
  background: blue; 
}
```

*6) Child*

This selects an element that is nested only one level deep inside of the specified parent element. It only selects direct children and not grandchildren. This selector is indicated by a > (greater than) symbol between the parent and the child to be selected.

```
<ul id="list">
  <li>child</li>
  <li>child
    <ul>
      <li>grand child</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
```

```
#list > li {
  border: 1px solid black;
}
```

*7) Adjacent Sibling*

This selects an element that appears directly after the former element assuming they are both siblings (in the same level of nesting, in the same parent). 
This selector is indicated by a + symbol between the former sibling and the selected element that follows.

```
<h3>Heading</h3>
  <p>
    I'm a paragraph that is selected Because I come directly after an H3.
  </p>
  <p>
    I'm not selected ;(
  </p>
```

```
h3 + p {
  color: green;
}
```

*General Sibling* 

This selects all elements that appear directly after the former element. This selector is indicated by a ~ tilde symbol between the former sibling and the selected element that follows it.

```
<h2>Sub Heading</h2>
  <p>
    I'm selected because I appear after an h2.
  </p>
  <p>
    I'm also selected for the same reason, in fact any paragraphs on the rest of the page after the h2 I will be selected. :) 
  </p>
```

```
h2 ~ p {
  color: black;
}
```

*Universal*

This selects elements where the properties specified have not been styled by any other selectors. This selector is indicated by an * asterik symbol. 

``` 
* {
  color: orange;
}
```
```
<h5> I was selected because I haven't specified a color style for h5 anywhere else yet on our CSS so they will get the color orange now being covered under the universal selector. 
```

*Attribute* 

This selects an element with a matching attribute value. This selector is indicated by square brackets : [], followed by the attribute property and value of the selected element within the brackets. 

```
<img src="myimage.png" alt="Cat"> 
```

```
img[alt="Cat"] {
  border: 1px solid black; 
}
```

*Other Attribute Selectors Include*

```
a[href^="http"] The ^= caret symbol and equals sign select elements that start with the matching value, such as <a href="http://google.com">google</a>.

p[class$="dog"] The $= dollar and equals signs select elements that end with the matching value, such as <p class="bigbdog">...</a>.

img[alt*="love"] The *= asterisk and equals sign select elements that have the matched characters appearing anywhere within the value, such as <img src="myimage.jpg" alt="I love you.">.

p[class~="monkey"] The ~= tilde symbol and equals sign select elements that contain the term within a space separated value, such as <p class="zoo monkey details">...</p>.

p[class|="birds"] The |= pipe symbol selects elements that contain the term within a dash separated value, such as <p class="new-birds-today">...</p>.
