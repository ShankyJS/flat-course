# Getting Started with HTML

HTML is the "language" of the web, so as a user of the web, it's the language we have spent the majority of my time. 

## Anatomy of an HTML tag

The fundamental building block of HTML is a tag. 
Tags allows developers to tell things to the browser like "this text have to be a header and include an image". 

Tags all follow the same formate like this: 

```
<tag-text>
<br> #Create a new line. 
```
Most HTML tags work just like this:


-[]Opening tag, which states what kind of tag weâ€™re using;
-[]The text we want the tag to be applied to;
-[]Closing tag, which makes sure the tag is limited to a certain piece of text.

## Basic HTML Document Structure.

```
<html> 
 <head>
 </head>
 <body>
   <h1>Profile</h1>
